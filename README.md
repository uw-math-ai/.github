# Math AI lab at UW

The Math-AI lab provides a space for mathematicians at any level (faculty, postdocs, PhD students, undergraduates, high school students, ...) to learn about formalizing mathematics with Lean, as well as learn about the intersection between Math and AI. See some of our past projects [here](https://sites.math.washington.edu/~jarod/xll.html).

We also have a research [seminar](https://math.washington.edu/events/series/math-ai-seminar).
